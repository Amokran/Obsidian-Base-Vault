# Obsidian-Base-Vault
A pre-configured obsidian vault with pre-installed  plugins and themes

This might evolve adding new plugins or configurations that I found should be part of any new vault.
The idea is cloning this as a basic vault and then adding content without having to spend time installing and configuring plugins, themes, etc.

Some of the themes used come as a git submodule.
